# Business Analytics Project:

## Title: A Competative Market Analysis on Edu-Tech Companies For Non Profit Organisation 

**Info:** This is a comprehensive analysis on the top Edu-Tech companies in the Indian Market. This project shows the insights and how the consumers are affected.

My project focuses on the issue of Human Resources and unskilled labour issue. The workforce of India are unfit to meet the industrial work standards after they have finished their education. So, they turn to expensive paid courses in the hope that they can aquire a job of their liking. My project highlights this issue and creates the awareness that education institutions only give knowledge but no practical skills. Anyone can learn anything with determination.
